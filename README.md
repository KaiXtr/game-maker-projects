# game-maker-projects
 Small games I've made in my early youth using Game Maker Studio

Game information by date of creation:

* TUTORIALS
  I've made this project for a old channel where I used to make
  Game Maker Studio tutorials, but I started using this project
  to test another things and system I would implement later
  in other games.
  
* PONG REVOLUTION
  With big ambicions in game development and short experience,
  I decided to slow down and create a simplier game, an upgrade
  of the classic arcade game PONG, it would support lots of
  game modes, game options, themes and achievements. Later I
  renamed the game to PONG TOURNAMENT.
  
* JOKEY CARDS GENERATOR
  I was kind of entusiastmed with card games and this kind of thing,
  so I wanted to create my own card game, then I used my knowledge
  of programming to create a fast and eficient way to generate
  those cards randomly.
  
* 3D TEST
  A simple test with game maker studio d3d.
  
* ANYTHING
  I've made this in a time where I almost gave up of game creation,
  developing games wasn't a thing of my routine, then I had a bad day
  and I was feeling really sad, then I created this game with no
  compromisse just to kill my time.
  
* STEROIDS
  It's a game I have made just for fun and humor, it's based on
  brazilian memes from 2014 so maybe you won't get it. It's basicaly
  Asteroids, but instead of shooting Asteroids, you shoot bodybuilders.
  
* CHEMICAL VOYAGER
  I wanted to make a game that would be like Spore or Agar.io, then I
  created this game where the player control this nanoship in the size
  of a quark, and it grows until it becomes a galaxy.
  
* SAPUCAIA FANTASY
  I wanted to make a simple city game, but themed with the mesoamerican
  culture, this was the only point and click game I have done.
  
* THE BROKEN FACTORY
  I Triyed to participate in game jam, the Amdre Young's channel Game Jaaj 3,
  the theme was "Not everything is at it seems", and the idea was a little
  puzzle platform where a robot needs to fix a factory, but the usual
  concepts of games are all over the place, coins make you die, enemies
  help you etc.
  
* ANARQUISM WARS
  I know, "Anarchism" is spelled wrong. I liked so much the Grow mobile board
  game "WAR" that I wanted to make my own version, where each enemy is a
  anarchist school.
